### 📂 FIND UP
◈ Want to know if the minecraft server you selected is currently enabled? Or maybe you want to know how many people are currently playing? With the "Find Up" project, you can do this without going to the server! All you have to do is enter the server IP in the search field and the website will display all the most important information!

### 🔎 IP FINDER
◈ When you enter the IP of a server that does not exist in the search box, you will find the message **server not found** in place of the server information. 

### 🌐 WEBSITE UPDATES
◈ The **Find Up** project page will be improved to the point that it can provide each person with the most necessary information in a nice, clear look of the site!

### 📣 BUGS & UPDATES
◈ In the **Issues** tab you will find all the information about new products on the website or in the Find Up project! 

### 🎨 COLORS & DESIGN
◈ The entire **Find Up** design is based on black and green so that it contrasts well with each other and that the text is clearly visible.
